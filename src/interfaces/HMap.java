/**
 * An object that maps keys to values. A map cannot contain duplicate keys; each key can map to at most one value.
 * The Map interface provides three collection views, which allow a map's contents to be viewed as a set of keys, collection of values, or set of key-value mappings
 * Some map implementations have restrictions on the keys and values they may contain.
 * For example, some implementations prohibit null keys and values, and some have restrictions on the types of their keys.
 * Attempting to insert an ineligible key or value throws an unchecked exception, typically NullPointerException or ClassCastException.
 * ttempting to query the presence of an ineligible key or value may throw an exception, or it may simply return false;
 * some implementations will exhibit the former behavior and some will exhibit the latter.
 * More generally, attempting an operation on an ineligible key or value whose completion would not result in the insertion
 * of an ineligible element into the map may throw an exception or it may succeed, at the option of the implementation.
